   notes: Are there stronger characters than the Fitz and the Fool? What depth of emotion. This series is a magical climax and feels like it rivals the original assassin trilogy! Loved reading this series.

   date_finished: 06/26/2021
   notes: Onwards into the Robin Hobb cinematic universe! This series starts somewhat slowly but I love the all new (or is it!) version of live ships and their unique "magic".

   author: Robin Hobb

   image: https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/4873-L.jpg
   date_finished: 04/19/2021
   notes: I love this trilogy so much. This is my third or fourth full re-read since I was a teenager and it remains magical each time. Such world building, characters and adventure. Onwards to the remaining.... *checks notes*.... 14 books!
 - title: Royal Assassin
   author: Robin Hobb

   date_finished: 03/24/2021
   notes: That last line!! Such depth of characters. I really love this series. World building, unique ideas around magic, politics, love, wolves, assassins! Love it. Just as good as I remember.

   notes: Diving back into an epic read of the 17 Robin Hobb books. The farseer trilogy is my all time fave and I've read these books several times before but I'm starting here to read them all in order.
 - title: The mushroom at the end of the world
   author: Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing

   image: http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8881648-L.jpg

   notes: A really magical exploration of global capitalism and... mushrooms?!
 - title: A Memory Called Empire
   author: Arkady Martine
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Memory-Called-Empire-Arkady-Martine-ebook/dp/B07C7BCB88
   date_finished: 02/10/2021
   notes: What richness! The first time I've read sci-fi that felt a bit like Iain M Banks. Deep, complex, rich worlds with strong characters. An absolute treat - spanning langauge, poetry, politics, identity, memory and more. I cannot wait for the followup. After reading so much poorly written sci fi recently (Dune, The Ministry of the Future, Exhalation..) this was a refreshing breath of fresh air.
 - title: Laughter in the Dark
   author: Vladamir Nabakov
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Laughter-Vintage-International-Vladimir-Nabokov-ebook-dp-B004KABE1K/dp/B004KABE1K/
   date_finished: 01/17/2021
   notes: An airbnb read. Just lovely poetic writing - a breath of fresh air after a bunch of badly-written scifi.
 - title: The Ministry for the Future
   author: Kim Stanley Robinson
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Ministry-Future-Kim-Stanley-Robinson-ebook/dp/B084FY1NXB 
   date_finished: 01/10/2021
   notes: Abandoned during the free preview. Everyone is raving about this book but honestly the writing felt incredibly flat. I'm tired of sci-fi stories having bad writing :(
 - title: Exhalation
   author: Ted Chiang
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Exhalation-Stories-Ted-Chiang-ebook/dp/B07GD46PQZ 
   date_finished: 01/04/2021
   notes: Abandoned 2/3 of the way through :( - while I quite enjoyed some of the provocations in the stories ultimately the writing didn't captivate me. Left me feeling bored so I gave it up.
 - title: Multidimensional Executive Coaching
   author: Ruth L. Orenstein
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Multidimensional-Executive-Coaching-Ruth-Orenstein/dp/0826125662 
   date_finished: 01/06/2021
   notes: Some great thought provoking ideas about coaching, consulting and being embedded inside organizations as an outsider. I especially love the concept in the book of overbounded or underbounded organizations.
 - title: The Player of Games
   author: Iain M. Banks
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Player-Games-Culture-Iain-Banks/dp/0316005401
   date_finished: 12/01/2020
   notes: I have fond memories of the first time reading this and felt like it left a big impression on me. Re-reading this book I still loved it but the shine has come off a little - I think other culture books are perhaps better. Still, the world building (universe building!) that Iain M Banks does is like no other.
 - title: Dune
   author: Frank Herbert
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Dune-Frank-Herbert/dp/0441172717
   date_finished: 11/31/2020
   notes: Started reading this while traveling through Utah and Arizona to get a feel for desert living. I enjoyed the book but definitely didn't feel like it lived up to the hype. Inventive but the characters felt a little stale.
 - title: "Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software"
   author: Nadia Eghbal
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Working-Public-Making-Maintenance-Software/dp/0578675862
   date_finished: 10/15/2020
   notes: A great read about internet creators, economics of production, communities, influencers, open source and more. Nadia provides a ton of real data and examples but pairs them with big ideas and concepts. Essential read.
 - title: The Uncertainty Mindset
   author: Vaughn Tan
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Uncertainty-Mindset-Innovation-Insights-Frontiers-ebook/dp/B0825CZQR8   
   date_finished: 08/31/2020
   notes: A wonderful rich book exploring the world of high end culinary R&D to find lessons applicable for other types of organizations. A really fun read - great stories about high end cooking as well as sharp insights about food.
 - title: Tomorrow Lies in Ambush
   author: Bob Shaw
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Tomorrow-Lies-Ambush-Bob-Shaw-ebook/dp/B00GVFQJDU
   date_finished: 08/22/20
   notes: Classic sci-fi short stories recommended by Matt Webb. Some really lovely ideas and great writing! All the stories are very character-driven and often reflect more strongly on the individual characters motives and identities over the larger sci-fi conceits! Lovely. Thanks Matt!
 - title: East of Eden
   author: John Steinbeck
   link: https://www.amazon.com/East-Eden-Penguin-Orange-Collection/dp/0143129481
   date_finished: 07/29/20
   notes: What a magnificent - truly epic work. I'm a big Steinbeck fan already and I think I even read this one previously but loved immersing myself in this wonderful story. The biblical theme is almost too strong at times but is richly counterbalanced by Steinbeck's incredibly loving character portraits. Amazing.
 - title: Veil
   author: Eliot Peper
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Veil-Eliot-Peper-ebook/dp/B085PSTJNC   
   date_finished: 06/08/20
   notes: A really great fast-paced read. Eliot has a great knack for constructing plausible near-futures and then situating fully realized human stories within those futures. Thought provoking and enjoyable.
 - title: The Memory Police
   author: Yoko Ogawa
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Memory-Police-Novel-Yoko-Ogawa/dp/1101870605
   date_finished: 05/17/20
   notes: While the writing style at times is captivating - like a penny falling into a deep well - often the writing was unremarkable and the plot unfolded fairly slowly. All in the book was, ironically, forgettable. That said - the ending, where bodies start to fade away really resonated during this period of lockdown and isolation - it captures the essence of my embodied self fading away into an infinite series of zoom screens.
 - title: Working Identity- Unconventional Strategies for Reinventing Your Career
   author: Herminia Ibarra
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Working-Identity-Unconventional-Strategies-Reinventing/dp/1591394139
   date_finished: 05/15/20
   notes: A wonderful meditation on career change (and life change generally) as being a process of iterating and trying on new identities. Has deep implications for independents also. Going to blog this book up. Originally found via Vaughn Tan's newsletter.
 - title: An Introduction to Haiku
   author: Harold Gould Henderson
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Haiku-Anthology-Poems-Poets/dp/0385093764
   date_finished: 03/12/20
   notes: Brian suggested I get into Haiku and pick up this book and I'm glad I did! Beautiful, easy to read intro to Haiku. The author gives great context for what Haiku is, the main poets and how to read Haiku poetry. Recommended!
 - title: Tears of the Trufflepig
   author: Fernando A. Flores
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Tears-Trufflepig-Novel-Fernando-Flores/dp/0374538336
   date_finished: 01/09/20
   notes: A wonderful book. Like an absurdist Cormac McCarthy x Kurt Vonnegut mashup. Lyrical descriptions, wonderful characters and a wild imagination. Highly recommended.
 - title: A Winter’s Promise
   author: Christelle Dabos
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Winters-Promise-Mirror-Visitor-Quartet-ebook/dp/B07B8WK17G
   date_finished: 12/30/19
   notes: There are moments when the lavish fantasy world and the magic contained in it sucked me in - but ultimately the character development and plot just didn't hang together to keep me reading. Good escapist reading but there are better fantasy worlds to lose yourself in than this one.
 - title: Less
   author: Andrew Sean Greer
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Less-Winner-Pulitzer-Prize-Novel/dp/0316316121
   date_finished: 12/20/19
   notes: A truly delightful novel - with hints of PG Wodehouse. This book really sucked me in with magical lush writing and a great wry tone. Definitely recommended.
 - title: Infinite Detail
   author: Tim Maughan
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Infinite-Detail-Novel-Tim-Maughan/dp/0374175411
   date_finished: 12/1/19
   notes: A fun quick read. There's some good language and some nice world-setting but I wish some of the characters had been more fully developed and I wish the central idea had been stronger. The ending kind of fizzles out and there could have been room for so much more here.. Good for a little lightweight-dytopia though.
 - title: Dead Astronauts
   author: Jeff VanderMeer
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Dead-Astronauts-Novel-Jeff-VanderMeer/dp/0374276803
   date_finished: 11/15/19
   notes: I think perhaps I made a mistake. I didn't realize until after I'd read it that it was part of the Borne series. Maybe that would have been useful because this book made zero sense. Like a William Burroughs book it was somehow interesting and riveting at times despite literally making no sense. Did I mention it makes no sense? The first section with the three astronauts was the most compelling..... Maybe I should read the other Borne books and it'll make more sense? But I doubt it.
 - title: The Nix
   author: Nathan Hill
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Nix-Nathan-Hill/dp/1101970340
   date_finished: 10/28/19
   notes: Abandoned 500 pages in. I tried to keep going but just couldn't. A Very Bad Book. Highly un-recommended. <a href='https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/09/how-novelty-ruined-the-novel'>This is a good takedown</a>. So many characters are badly written sexually frustrated males and it's just all round a bad book. Couple sentences worth savoring but.. ugh.
 - title: A Gentleman in Moscow
   author: Amor Towles
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Gentleman-Moscow-Novel-Amor-Towles-ebook/dp/B01COJUEZ0
   date_finished: 10/03/19
   notes: Amor is a wonderful writer with so many lyrical touches, flourishes and turns of phrase. The feel of the book of politics, culture and acting in the proper way is great. Without posting spoilers there's a few themes in the book that make me feel like the book was written by a man - that some of the more emotionally rich moments are skipped over... But overall highly recommended as a fun, engaging and lyrical book.
 - title: Tempo - timing, tactics and strategy in narrative-driven decision-making 
   author: Venkatesh Rao
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Tempo-tactics-strategy-narrative-driven-decision-making-ebook/dp/B0069CHSLW
   date_finished: 09/09/19
   notes: I really should have read this years ago but I really enjoyed this piece. The core ideas around tempo of interactions, narrative time and that the kitchen is the best way to think about time will all stick with me for a while. Recommended.
 - title: Conversation -  How Talk Can Change Our Lives
   author: Theodore Zeldin
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Conversation-How-Talk-Change-Lives/dp/1587680009
   date_finished: 09/04/19
   notes: A delightful little book that was a gift from my friend Brian. A little meditation on conversations, how important they are and some of the explicit and implicit ways they can go wrong. At first I thought this was going to offer solutions and ideas but mostly it just offers poetry and provocations. I think it'll stick with me for a long time though - and the art from the author scattered through the book makes a lovely little object. Thanks Brian!
 - title: Recursion
   author: Blake Crouch
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Recursion-Novel-Blake-Crouch-ebook/dp/B07HDSHP7N
   date_finished: 9/3/19
   notes: A fast-paced, high-action read. A fun time-travel romp with some great characters. Ultimately I thought the premise was smart and the writing handled it well but the whole novel felt a little shallow. There were some really meaty ideas about identity and family wrapped up here that kind of got sidelined for the sake of the technology-driven plot and I thought that was a shame. Fun read though.
 - title: Way Station
   author: Clifford D. Simak
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Way-Station-Clifford-D-Simak-ebook/dp/B00YO78RRS
   date_finished: 8/25/19
   notes: Lovely vintage sci-fi recommended by Chris Butler. There's aliens, teleporting and... magic? But nothing flashy happens - it's an incredibly human story. This is a really thoughtful and fresh story. Highly recommended.
 - title: Idiots First
   author: Bernard Malamud
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Idiots-First-Bernard-Malamud/dp/0374174202
   date_finished: 8/15/19
   notes: The opening line of Idiot's First is a masterpiece. 'The thin ticking of the tin clock stopped'. Loved a few of the other stories but some were definitely forgettable. I'd recommend dipping your toe in and at the very least reading the title story Idiots First.
 - title: The Scar
   author: China Miéville
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Scar-China-Mi%C3%A9ville/dp/0345460014
   date_finished: 08/06/19
   notes: Ah what delicious sludgy, dark, human texture. China Miéville's descriptive language and world building is unparalleled. This is book two (after reading Perdido Street Station last year). These books are long and luxurious so perhaps not the best entry point if you're new to his writing but if you like this kind of thing there's nothing better. My only quarrel with this book was the ending... It felt somewhat unsatisfying, or rather unfinished - where a typical book resolves this felt like the open sea was still in front of you? But it's a very minor comment as mostly the strength of this book was that every page told a lifetime of texture. Definitely going to read book three of this trilogy after a break.
 - title: Last Night
   author: James Salter
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Last-Night-Stories-James-Salter/dp/1400078415
   date_finished: 07/14/19
   notes: After reading All That Is I had to wash my palette and get back to some of his delicious writing. This was much more in line with Light Years and contained some lovely moments. None of the short stories will linger with me too long but it's a short read and I'd recommend it.
 - title: Emissaries Guide to Worlding
   author: Ian Cheng
   link: https://serpentine-galleries.myshopify.com/products/coming-soon-ian-cheng-emissaries-guide-to-worlding
   notes: The core idea of the masks - the cartoonist, the director, the hacker and the emissary - is wonderful and a new lens to look at the world through, so overall I'd recommend the book. But there was also an incredible over-indulgence from the author to live inside his own worlds (which feels very finite game like, not infinite game like). And the lack of people anywhere in his worlds is also problematic. That said - the book as an object is beautiful and wonderfully designed.

 - title: The Prisoner
   author: Thomas M. Disch
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Prisoner-Novel-Thomas-M-Disch/dp/014311722X
   notes: I really enjoyed this - a delightfully British story of being trapped, like a combination of Kafka and PG Wodehouse. The plot derailed itself in a few places and there was a whole Shakespere reference that kind of went over my head but the writing was wonderful. Recommended.
   date_finished: 7/7/19
 - title: Oval
   author: Elvia Wilk
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Oval-Novel-Elvia-Wilk/dp/1593764057
   date_finished: 6/24/19
   notes: I really loved this. Distinctive, fresh writing that captures so much of the present weirdness in society while also somehow feeling timeless. The middle third dragged slightly for me but the descent into ecological weird towards the end is just wonderful and reminds me of the Annihiliation series by Jeff Vandermeer. Oh and the whole book centers on this premise of artists becoming 'consultants' which is magnificent. Recommended. Verdict- 👍🌲
 - title: All That Is
   author: James Salter
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007WKFMGS
   date_finished: 06/09/2019
   notes: A wildly disappointing read. Not that it was so bad but that having recently read Light Years I was expecting so much more. There were moments of brilliance in the writing and some of the scenes will linger with me overall the book didn't really make me feel anything. Definitely read Light Years instead.
 - title: Borderless
   author: Eliot Peper
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BM7F9SF
   date_finished: 5/20/2019
   notes: Book two of the Analog series. Overall I connected less with the main character in this one but connected more with the overall premise which is very thought provoking. It feels today that we are actively living through the end (or at least a phase transition) of sovereignty. Compelling and a quick read.
 - title: Bandwidth
   author: Eliot Peper
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075CLV95J/
   date_finished: 5/13/2019
   notes: I completely devoured this book. The characters and pace keeps it flowing but the ideas will stick with me - it's grounded in a very near future and the concepts are well thought through. Excited to keep diving into Borderless next.
 - title: The Gone Away World
   author: Nick Harkaway
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001EL6R9W/
   date_finished: 5/07/2019
   notes: A majestic feat of imagination - whirlwind story of a gong-fu epic in a world gone mad. Definitely feels like it needed better editing or structuring and was about 100 pages too long but the strength of imagination and grasp of poetry really captivated me. Picked this up off the street on the way home from kung-fu training (approriate!). I'll be reading more of his work.
 - title: Light Years
   author: James Salter
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004G8PIOA/
   date_finished: 4/12/2019
   notes: This book completely destroyed me. The writing is dense and poetic like almost no one I've ever read. Did you know glass is a liquid and slowly 'flows'? This book operates on a time horizon and 'flows' through lives in a deeply transformative way. Found via <a href='https://www.gyford.com/phil/writing/2019/02/15/light-years-james-salter/'>Phil Gyford</a>
 - title: Delirious New York
   author: Rem Koolaas
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JYVYUUW/
   date_finished: 3/18/2019
   notes: It's architecture writing but lyrical, magical and opinionated. A tour de force through New York's history with tons of interesting characters, ideas, explorations and more. Ideas include congestion as an organizing principle of the city, and every block being an archipelago. Wonderful and highly recommended.
 - title: Tomorrow In The Battle Think On Me
   author: Javier Marias
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307950751 
   date_finished: 2/17/2019
   notes: Abandoned. I think somewhere in this book is buried a wonderful treasure. The looping self-aware story is fundamentally interesting and new but the language that wraps around it chokes it to death. Abandoned about half way through.
 - title: Summerland
   author: Hannu Rajaniemi
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0756K1Q8D/
   date_finished: 1/21/2019
   notes: A wonderful original work - full of interesting characters. Ghosts! Spys! Old London! Really enjoyed this and tore through it super fast.
 - title: Finite & Infinite Games
   author: James Carse
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004W3FM4A/
   date_finished: 1/10/2019
   notes: Great unique book, wonderful analogy to finite and infinite writing....
 - title: The Power
   author: Naomi Alderman
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N0Z1EY0
   date_finished: 12/30/2018
   notes: Provocative premise but I felt it squandered an opportunity at a deeper political and/or emotional exploration of what would happen if teenage girls gained a new incredible power. Somehow it resorted to.... fucking and fighting?
 - title: Perdido Street Station
   author: China Mieville
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FBFO8C/
   date_finished: 12/01/2018
   notes: A staggering, creative, filthy, engrossing tour through a world with such magical and rich depths. No one can build worlds like China.
 - title: Satin Island
   author: Tom McCarthy
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MZWA678/
   date_finished: 03/21/2018
   notes: William Gibson meets Kafka. A corporate strategy consultant / ethnographer ponders the meaning of life and searches for the Great Report.

   author: Samantha Hunt
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N0TDSVM/
   date_finished: 02/15/2018
   notes: Tender, oozing, lyrical, dark, DARK stories of being human. Did I mention they are dark? What writing though! What imagination!
