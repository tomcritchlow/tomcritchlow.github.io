Generosity is a core flywheel

What are status indicators for how healthy your business is?

Fundamental equation of:

Revenue = (deals) * (value)

I'm leaving this intentionally abstract

Deals obviously is a mixture of leads, conversion rate, 

Value is a mixture of how much you're closing for, LTV, retainer, whether you need to pull in collaborators (i.e. margin) etc etc.

Fundamentally the big two levers that you can pull are:

1. Have more interesting conversations
2. Work with clients on bigger/longer projects to get more value

I think the right balance is to track conversations.
