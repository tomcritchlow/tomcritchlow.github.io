This is a simple post to serve as a reference point for a concept that I think is simple and powerful. Just like double entry accounting revolutionised the way we do book-keeping I think triple-entry blogging 

Triple-entry publishing for my blog is a simple concept that has completely transformed how I think about blogging. It's as simple as this: by design every time I write and publish a blog post it's stored in three places:

- My local machine (stored as text markdown file)
- Github (where my blog is hosted and published)
- tomcritchlow.com (where all kinds of spiders crawl over it)

That's it! But the workflow of writing locally and pushing to the cloud means that I always have the most up to date copy of my site on my machine. There's no export button because it's already exported.

Yes - I know, this workflow ignores mobile. There are ways of publishing to Jekyll/Github Pages from mobile but I don't personally have a need for that.

This resiliency means that while Github is a good host for me now there's zero lock-in and no proprietary formats. I have all the files locally ready to switch to a new platform / environment. But, if my laptop is stolen then I can easily recover a full copy on a new machine and carry on.

Triple entry blogging.

Workflowy does this to a degree - when you "export" all you do is open the same text in plain text for you to copy and paste elsewhere. This is the kind of portability we dream of.
