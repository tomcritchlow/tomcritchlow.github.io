Maybe a YAML file that generates SVG using JS? Clickable links?

Maybe I can make the map alive?
- What if I put the sites in Gsheets
- Fetch RSS for each
- Lay them out on some kind of map
- Add a little red dot to ones that updated in the last week

This is similar to the blog gardens idea hmmm?!
