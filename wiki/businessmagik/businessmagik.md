More data = more reliance on intuition.

Spiritual has been uncoupled from religious.

Occult ads.
Machine "visions"
Glitches or ghosts

Ghosts in the machine and glitches in the streets. Our sense of the otherworldly has shifted.

>In Robert's account, as in Geoffrey's Historia, Merlin is created as a demon spawn to become the Antichrist and reverse the effect of the Harrowing of Hell. This plot is thwarted when a priest named Blaise immediately baptizes the boy at birth, thus freeing him from the power of Satan and his intended destiny.[14] The demonic legacy invests Merlin with a preternatural knowledge of the past and present, which is supplemented by God, who gives the boy a prophetic knowledge of the future. Robert lays great emphasis on Merlin's power to shapeshift,[note 1] on his joking personality, and on his connection to the Holy Grail, the quest for which he foretells.

A universal theory of BusinessMagik

Merlin was the OG consultant
Of kings and queens and consultants (and mages and jesters)
Business functions like a monarchy
There's a reason we talk about samurai and freelancers

Skills of the mage (consultant):
- Scrying
- Soothsaying
- Truth-telling
- Divination
- Spells
- Wisdom
