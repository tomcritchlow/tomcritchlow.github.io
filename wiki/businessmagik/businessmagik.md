Occult ads.
Machine "visions"
Glitches or ghosts

Ghosts in the machine and glitches in the streets. Our sense of the otherworldly has shifted.

>In Robert's account, as in Geoffrey's Historia, Merlin is created as a demon spawn to become the Antichrist and reverse the effect of the Harrowing of Hell. This plot is thwarted when a priest named Blaise immediately baptizes the boy at birth, thus freeing him from the power of Satan and his intended destiny.[14] The demonic legacy invests Merlin with a preternatural knowledge of the past and present, which is supplemented by God, who gives the boy a prophetic knowledge of the future. Robert lays great emphasis on Merlin's power to shapeshift,[note 1] on his joking personality, and on his connection to the Holy Grail, the quest for which he foretells.

Of kings and queens and consultants (and mages and jesters)

There's a reason we talk about samurai and freelancers

Skills of the mage (consultant):
- Scrying
- Soothsaying
- Truth-telling
- Divination
- Spells
- Wisdom

“Ideas about a person's place in society, his role, lifestyle, and ego qualities will lose their hold as the cohesive forces in society disintegrate. Subculture values will proliferate to such a bewildering extent that a whole new class of professionals will arise to control them. Such a Transmutation Technology will deal in fashions, in ways of being. Lifestyle consultants will become the new priests of our civilizations. They will be the new magicians.”
