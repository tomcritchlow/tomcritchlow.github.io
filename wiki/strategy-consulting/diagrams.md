## Diagrams and Doodles

How do diagrams and doodling fit into strategy consulting? They're related and adjacent. I believe doodling and diagrams are good practice for creating **frameworks**. See my post here for more on that:

Below are some interesting diagrams, doodlers and examples I've collected. Hopefully I'll keep this updated:


### Venkatesh Rao of Ribbonfarm fame

Venkatesh has tons. Drawings, doodles, diagrams, flows and more. Some faves:

>Many beginning consultants have a weird kind of insecurity that leads them to invent and rely on over-complicated, bespoke constructs that they can name after themselves. While these can sometimes be useful, especially ones that are developed and refined over many years, across hundreds of applications, such as Wardley maps, in general, they are fragile visual bullshit. You’re much better off learning to use the basic commodity diagrams well than trying to make up and sell your own in most cases.

### Mark Pollard

All the good stuff is on Instagram: [@markpollard](https://www.instagram.com/markpollard/?hl=en)

###  Nahee cyberdiagrams (nsfw)

The best instagram account I follow. Hands down.

Imagine a venn diagram of cyberfeminism, erotica, developer manuals, code and art. Mildly NSFW:

### Hugh MacLeod

Ex-ad-agency starts doodling on business cards. Gets good. Becomes famous. Turns doodling into a strategy consulting firm. Magic.

### Wardly Maps

Related to the frameworks and diagrams idea is the notion of "wayfinding" in strategy. Most famously Wardly Maps. More on that here:

And there's a fun tool to build your own here:

### Misc

[Maps of the mind](https://twitter.com/pieratt/status/1143183857925152768) looks *delicious*.

>But beyond their two-dimensional depictions of a physical world, maps also afford us the freedom to express the cosmos; to make all kinds of ideas about the spatial relationships of multiple components unexpectedly clear. To draw one is an effective way to establish order on an otherwise chaotic environment. To make it navigable. To make it rational.

> **Sketching Science in the Seventeenth Century**
> ================================================
>
> What constitutes a sketch? We think at first of drawings and diagrams, but there are other forms of sketching. The OED offers several pertinent uses of the term, none of them earlier than the late 17th century. The first refers to the visual arts: "A rough drawing or delineation of something, giving the outlines or prominent features without the detail, esp. one intended to serve as the basis of a more finished picture, or to be used in its composition; a rough draught or design. Also, in later use, a drawing or painting of a slight or unpretentious nature." The second extends it to literary creations: "A brief account, description, or narrative giving the main or important facts, incidents, etc., and not going into the details; a short or superficial essay or study, freq\[uently\] in pl\[ural\] as a title." A third, rare usage, makes a sketch simply "\[t\]he general plan or outline, the main features, of anything". One can find all three sorts of sketches at work in the formation of the new science of the seventeenth century.
