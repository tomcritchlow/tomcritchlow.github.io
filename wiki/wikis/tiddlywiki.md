TiddlyWiki is a super interesting project - been around for 15 years(!) and is a notes/knowledge platform that is self-contained in a single file - and the controls are all embedded in it so you can kinda script the environment within the environment.

It's weird and promising and somehow is completely lacking in design!

It's getting some fresh traction - like:

And finally a TiddlyTheme that doesn't suck!!
