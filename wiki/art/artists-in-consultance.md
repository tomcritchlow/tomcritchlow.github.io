>As the mega-galleries continue to battle for market share, Gagosian, most often cited as the world’s largest gallery, is beefing up its technology team. Today the gallery shared exclusively with ARTnews that it has hired as a part-time senior adviser Sebastian Cwilich, the co-founder of Artsy. (...)
>Gagosian’s tech department is a relatively recent addition to the gallery, the result of its hire last year of a chief technology officer in Gareth O’Loughlin, formerly the vice president of technology at Casper, the mattress startup.
>“Gareth and Sebastian are both leaders in the field, with a broad range of skill sets and unique perspectives on technology, business strategy, and operations,” Larry Gagosian, the gallery’s founder, told ARTnews in a statement. “They will be great additions to the gallery, enhancing and expanding our innovative work.”

> Is the museum a thinktank, a platform, a consultancy? Ivanova now works as part of the Serpentine Galleries’ Research & Development Platform, a relatively new arm of the London institution. In March the platform published its first report on ‘Future Art Ecosystems’ (coproduced with consultancy Rival Strategy), in which it envisions art institutions as innovative early-adopters of emerging technologies, with section headings like ‘Tech Industry as Art Patron’, ‘Strategies for the Art-Industrial Revolution’ and the ‘Art Stack’.
