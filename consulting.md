What is the best way to build and sustain growth for your company? This is a problem that requires careful thinking, iterative design and strong leadership.

My work is focused on media companies and early/mid-stage startups. My expertise is in marketing and product strategy. For example - I've been hired by large media companies to focus on content strategy, mid-size startups to be an interim CMO and by product companies to help run design sprints to shape product roadmap.

## Growth

Where is your next phase of growth coming from? There's often no *right* answer to this question and often involves a process of experimentation and iteration.

I can help you answer this question whether it's sketching out a content strategy for a small startup or helping a large organization engage in new ways of thinking (usually by making).

## The Modern Marketing Team

We live in changing times and the modern marketing team needs to be agile to adapt. I help clients build modern marketing teams that are digital, nimble and design focused. This requires building out a team with a broad set of capabilities across design, product, engineering and growth.


## Product Strategy Beyond Sticky Notes

Steeped in the aesthetic of sticky notes and design sprints, too often innovation becomes an intangible thing when in fact product strategy and innovation should be the opposite; lightweight tangible things. I can help you take an actionable approach to innovation - one that requires *making* as a core skillset and rapid iteration as the focal point.


## My Best Work is On-Site

I work best embedded within teams so I can bring you pastries and smell the fires. Embedded systems reduce friction, make communication quicker and ultimately make projects succeed. By sitting with you and your teams I can help do the work and embed knowledge and abilities to ensure that your team is set up to succeed without me in the long run.

I'm based in New York City, but available to travel for work.
