title: Working with me
subtitle: I run a boutique consulting practice helping companies define and build digital marketing capabilities.

I've been working in digital marketing for over 10 years and an independent consultant for the last 2 years - working with media companies and startups - advising on content marketing, brand, audience development and growth.

Most work is done project-based where I define specific needs or problems and address them with speed. This ongoing work often revolves around the core principle of helping clients define and build new marketing capabilities - whether in content marketing, SEO, audience development or helping to lead brand positioning and market research.

## Building Better Teams

## Example Projects

I've worked with media companies such as **The New York Times** and **Complex Media** on audience development, SEO and content distribution.

I've worked with startups such as **Olapic**, **Fundera** and **Grovo** as an advisor - whether as interim CMO, strategy consultant or helping to build the marketing team from scratch.

Occasionally I've worked with marketing agencies such as **Distilled** as a strategy consultant and business advisor helping to build teams and processes to drive growth.
