title: Some notes on Thinking in Public
subtitle: An evolution of my small-b-blogging thesis
---

A few weeks ago my good friend Jim asked me if I'd run a little session for Part & Sum around the theme of "thinking in public". I love Jim and I love Part & Sum and I love thinking in public so I jumped at the opportunity!

That Part & Sum session spawned a salon in the [discord](https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/07/08/discord/) that became this figma file. I really need to find time to write this up into a more formal presentation but for now I'm capturing this figma file and sharing it out. I think there's lots of good ideas in here.

The basic thesis is this:

Start at the top and weave your way to the bottom - there's lots of sidenotes :)

[Thinking in public - figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/qFvsTtQ85fY1UZl78K5tY2/Thinking-in-Public?node-id=0%3A1)

I think this idea is especially relevant for those looking to create content in a B2B context (either an indie consultant or an agency) where expertise and "thinking" is important.

If you want to hire me for this kind of coaching / strategy work to help you define a public content strategy around "thinking in public" then you know where to find me.
