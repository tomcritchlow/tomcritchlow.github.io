How do you convince an organization to change? I'm a little obsessed with this question and spend probably an unhealthy amount of time self-reflecting on why clients do or do not execute on the things I'm recommending.

I came across two frameworks recently which really helped me think about it:

## A Framework for Thinking about Systems Change

From [this excellent blog post](https://intenseminimalism.com/2015/a-framework-for-thinking-about-systems-change/) comes this graphic which really needs no explanation:

What I love about this is it has the diagnosis built in. Feeling anxiety? It's because you are missing the right skills. Confusion? Missing vision.

Love it.

## But, what if everything was execution?

From Tom Peters comes this presentation on [the excellence dividend](http://tompeters.com/2018/04/excellence-dividendin-powerpoint-annotated/). It's nice having a framework, but what if ultimately the whole thing is just a relentless focus on execution?

Tons of thought provoking ideas in here.
