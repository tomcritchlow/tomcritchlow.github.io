It's fun when you bump into fellow travelers on the road... Matt Webb has been on his own journey for the past five years and [wrote up some thoughts here](http://interconnected.org/home/2019/11/13/mwie).

Congrats on making it this far Matt!

I'm still testing and fiddling with webmention replies and I thought I'd highlight a few passages from Matt's piece:

>Let’s call it product discovery and market discovery. Business-speak as camouflage for feelings.

Ah... yes. Being independent drops things to feeling, emotion and identity very quickly. I recognize this.

>That last point all about what we’d call in other contexts product-market fit. That hyphen is an arrow of influence that points both ways.
>
>Marketing requires a view on what the market finds valuable; what will resonate. In my case, how clients will find and understand business value. Not only have I lacked up-to-date knowledge of what value I, personally, can unlock, but prematurely working on marketing will shape the product before it’s ready.
>
>And what is the “product” here? Well it’s me, my practice — it’s some overlap of what I find stimulating, what I’m good at, and what helps me get future work which is the same but better. But can I articulate that? Not a chance.

There's a few things at work here - yes you can't escape the feeling that "you're the product", BUT - equally the pressure and stress that comes from attempting to find a "positioning" is mostly self-inflicted. I found it very freeing once I realized that I could continue to be the weirdo multi-faceted being I am and that clients would mostly continue to not care...

>I’m not doing enough public speaking of the sort that I enjoy — I feel I’ve lost touch with my tribe, and I miss that.

Me too! I want to talk more about this but I think it's surprisingly hard to get speaking gigs as an independent. I used to do a ton of these and now do very few. I'd like to do more but I'm not sure where to start - except to recognize that it's a common refrain from independents....

Anyway - congrats Matt. Thanks for sharing. Here's to another 5 years on the road for both of us!
