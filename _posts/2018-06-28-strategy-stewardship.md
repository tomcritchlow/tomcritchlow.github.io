title: On strategy and stewardship
subtitle: A model for retained strategy consulting
---

The problem with strategy work is that it's often a sprint. A short burst of work, done periodically to set the vision and the strategy. If you enjoy strategy work, are you doomed to chase short term strategy sprints?

And, by the way, who's ensuring that the execution of the strategy is in line with the vision?

While building my consulting practice over the past 3.5 years I've accidentally stumbled on a way to be involved in strategy work and then stick around for the long term execution (In fact when I looked it up recently I see that my average client retention for retainers is 20 months). I believe this is good for my clients and good for my consulting practice. They get more than just powerpoints and I get retained revenue. Everyone wins.

It all comes down to the concept of strategy and stewardship, which I've been unwittingly adhering to for a long time but when I saw it articulated in print it really made something click.

> Without the broader stewardship arc, the design process is easily all about thinking and not doing — this is precisely what we see to be the difficulty with the ‘design thinking’ debate and its over-emphasis on helping people think differently. In the context of strategic design, ideas are important, but only when they lead to impact. Part of this is appreciating the quality with which an idea is executed and recognizing that quality of execution and quality of strategy are equally important. It is common these days for one group to be involved in analysis of a problem and designing the solution (consultants) while a different group executes these ideas (contractors). But this disconnects an essential feedback loop.

So, strategy without execution doesn't work. But the people that do strategy don't typically get involved in execution. The answer? Strategy and stewardship:

This is from page 15 of [Legible Practises by the Helsinki Design Lab](http://helsinkidesignlab.org/peoplepods/themes/hdl/downloads/Legible_Practises.pdf):

> We invoke stewardship in place of words like “implement” and “execute” out of recognition that the latter imply a cleanliness or linear progression which is rarely found when working on a shared proposition in a complex environment. Inside a factory plans can be executed, orders implemented, and outcomes delivered, but innovations that engage with the messy reality of the social sphere do not happen so neatly. What we describe also goes well beyond “facilitation,” which suggests that others do the important work. Stewardship shapes the course of innovation; it is not a neutral role. Think of stewardship as a form of leadership. One that acknowledges things will change along the way for better or for worse, therefore demanding agility over adherence to a predetermined plan. Many individuals who work in alliances or collaborative endeavors act as stewards almost naturally. If you are used to continually calibrating the goals of a project with the constraints of your context, you are practicing stewardship. If you maintain a constant state of opportunism and a willingness to pivot when progress on the current path is diminishing, you’re a natural steward

Strategy and stewardship. Yes. On the money.
