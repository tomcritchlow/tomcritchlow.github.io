title: Filtered for... Play

*Starting a new "Filtered for..." series [inspired by Matt Webb](http://interconnected.org/home/tagged/filtered-for)*

A theory of play - and playfulness - has been brewing for some time. Brian and I wrote up a theory of the "playtime CEO" for Little Futures:

<blockquote class="quoteback" data-title="LF04 - Play Not Prototypes" data-author="Little Futures" cite="https://littlefutures.club/2019/10/04/play/">
<p>But as the speed of reality increases, many organizations feel in a constant state of wartime. This can lead to tension, stress and confusion. If things are constantly changing are we doomed to exist in an endless war?
<br><br>
<strong>We hope not. Perhaps instead of the peacetime/wartime CEO duality we should consider a third way: the playtime CEO.</strong>
<br><br><strong>In a world that is constantly changing, organizations require a playful theory of operations- small, creative explorations as an always-on mode of action.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In a world that is constantly changing, organizations require a playful theory of operations- small, creative explorations as an always-on mode of action.</strong></p>

<p>So if you’re a business leader feeling the pressure of an accelerating world, consider creating a culture of playfulness:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Playfulness is a more important consideration than play. The former is an attitude of mind; the latter is a passing outward manifestation of this attitude.” - again from the book Lifelong Kindergarten</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short we need to informalize our ideas about the future and replace our prototypes with play to create small worlds that allow new mental models of the world to emerge.</p></p>

I really like this framing of knowledge work:

<blockquote class="quoteback" data-title="Deliberate Practice for Knowledge Work" data-author="Simon Sarris" cite="https://simonsarris.com/play">
<p>In other words, deliberate practice of knowledge work requires testing knowledge, and that is achieved by doing. Note taking is not the under-studied force of knowledge, play is.</p>

Of course, there's already a "universal theory of play" out there - Finite & Infinite Games:

<blockquote class="quoteback" data-title="Finite and Infinite Games: Two Ways to Play the Game of Life" data-author="@farnamstreet" cite="https://fs.blog/2020/02/finite-and-infinite-games-two-ways-to-play-the-game-of-life/">
<p>Infinite players, in contrast, look to the future. Because their goal is to keep the game going, they focus less on what happened, and put more effort into figuring out what’s possible. By playing a single, non-repeatable game, they are unconcerned with the maintenance and display of past status. They are more concerned with positioning themselves to deal effectively with whatever challenges come up.</p>
