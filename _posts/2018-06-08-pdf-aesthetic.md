title: PDF Aesthetics
subtitle: A publishing manifesto
---

Publishing a PDF is an act of rebellion. They work on every device. But they work perfectly on none. It's there on mobile but you have to pinch to read it. There's no rules or grids or frameworks for publishing them. They can look any way, polished or xeroxed. Big or small. PDFs will outlive Facebook. They are the cockroaches of media that will be here long after we're gone. They're ugly.

But their aesthetics are beautiful. Brutalist publishing that exposes the raw materials.

Some inspiration....
