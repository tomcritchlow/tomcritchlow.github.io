Hi there, I'm originally from Yorkshire in the UK and currently living in Brooklyn, NY. I can usually be found either drinking coffee or riding my bike. Occasionally both.

Here's what I'm working on right now:

 - Freelance marketing strategy for startups and media companies.
 - Playing the role of interim CMO & helping to hire senior marketing leadership for companies east coast and west coast. If you are looking for a senior marketing role please get in touch! tjcritchlow@gmail.com 
 - Running an <a href="http://www.fiercelycurious.com">art business</a>.
 - At the early stages of sketching out a new venture - a science fiction publishing company. Codename <a href="http://www.sentientscifi.com">Sentient</a>. Interested? Shoot me a note.
 
I'm pretty busy through the end of the year but at the start of 2016 I'm going to have some availability.
 
In the past I've done a lot of conference speaking - I'm open to new speaking opportunities so get in touch if you have an event you'd like me to speak at.
