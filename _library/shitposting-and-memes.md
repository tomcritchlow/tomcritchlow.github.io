Shitposting and memes as essential digital infrastructure. Very interested in Jonathan's new startup Antimatter that creates learning experiences through memes...

It’s impossible to tell <em>good</em> jokes about subjects you don’t fully understand, and very difficult to tell jokes that people with opposing opinions will enjoy and grapple with. To accomplish the latter you need to be informed enough about opposing opinion, generous enough to take it seriously, and above all confident enough to tell a joke that, taken at face value, inverts your actual opinion. This is shitposting.
