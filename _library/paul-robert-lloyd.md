Paul Robert Lloyd on creating "design histories":

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Using%20a%20design%20history%20to%20document%20your%20work" data-author="@paulrobertlloyd" cite="https://paulrobertlloyd.com/presentations/2021/03/discuss_a_design_challenge/">
<p>A design history looks both forwards and backwards. New posts show the team where a service is going, while older posts tell the story of how we got to where we are now.</p>
<p>That’s a fancy description. The simpler answer is that a design history is a blog with a design team committed to regularly posting about their work.</p>

Love the idea of using a simple blog to keep track of how a service has evolved and changed over time. Nothing fancy. Just good ol blogging.
