A great little meditation on Alan Jacob's line of inquiry on "Invitation & Repair"

As I’ve said many times before, I completely agree with Yuval Levin that it is indeed <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_Time_to_Build/yjebDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;printsec=frontcover" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a time to build</a>&nbsp;(or rebuild) our institutions, but the problem is that nobody <em>wants</em> to rebuild the institutions and they don’t want to rebuild them because they don’t <em>care</em> about them, they don’t <em>value</em> them, they don’t see what purpose they serve; for them an institution is simply an impediment to the achievement of their desires. In this kind of environment, I don’t see the rebuilding of the institutions as an <em>immediate</em> possibility. Americans today perceive institutions as repositories of resources for them to exploit.
