description: "Strategy isn’t just a plan to win. It’s the process by which you execute and refine that plan. And when done well, the strategy process is the best way to teach new leaders to think strategically."
insights:
 - "Organizations that learn to think strategically are those that treat it as a constant practice. That’s because strategy is not just a plan to win — it’s a process. Making strategy and executing strategy are two sides of the same coin. You don’t have a strategy. You do strategy. The trick is to build a management system for strategic discussion. Building a legible system fosters better decision-making. Just as important, it forces new leaders to practice strategy. Having to stand and deliver a plan for your team that fits into the company strategy is the best way to get better at thinking strategically."
