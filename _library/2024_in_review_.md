description: "A lot happened for me this year.
I continued learning the details of fund accounting at Carta,
which is likely the most complex product domain I’ve worked in.
My third book was published, and I did a small speaking tour to support it.
We started the unironically daunting San Francisco kindergarten application process.
I was diagnosed with skin cancer and had successful surgery to remove it.
All things considered, it was a much messier year than I intended,
but with many good pockets mixed in with the mess."
