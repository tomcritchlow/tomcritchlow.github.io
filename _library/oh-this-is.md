Oh! This is a magical website. Collection of essays that auto-compiles to a print on demand book. Very relevant to my interests:

The notion of a singular printing or edition obviously goes out the window when readers can recombine and print on demand as desired. "The book" in this context has to encompass all the machinery, the HTML and CSS, the server, the underlying content, the templates for the pages, the code to collate them, and the means of printing. Drawing attention to its own publishing to a degree a more traditionally constructed book might not. This is particularly visible, I think, on the cover for the on-demand print version of <em>On Publishing</em> where the logic of: "randomly place logos of those studios that have been included in this particular compilation so they do not overlap at one of a number of sizes" spans fifty lines of code that form the canonical notion of the cover.
