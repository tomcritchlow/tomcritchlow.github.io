Mmm. This Sane app looks pretty interesting. Graph/table/grid view of a set of texts. Has hints of a syllabus? Hints of arena? Hints of Electric Tables? Something interesting emerging here

<span>This White Space is part of an evolving research practice that forms the basis for Sane’s development. It sheds light on the thought processes behind our efforts to build meaningful tools for creating, collecting, and sharing knowledge online. It also functions as the first example and use case for what the product will look like. You can sign up for the waitlist at sane.fyi to be among the first to test it for yourself.</span>
