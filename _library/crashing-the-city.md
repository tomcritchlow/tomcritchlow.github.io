A fragment of an idea.

If the city is now cityOS - a networked urban environment - how might it be possible to "crash" the city?

[the city is my homescreen](https://medium.com/dark-matter-and-trojan-horses/the-city-is-my-homescreen-317673e0f57a)

Example ways to crash the city:
- Call 15 ubers/lyfts to the same location at the same time. Could you freeze a city block with traffic on demand?
- Hiring taskrabbits to "jam" a subway station by carrying large items through it
- Create a fake giveaway to swarm a place (e.g. hamilton ticket giveaway)

If the city is now cityOS then "bugs" in the system can "crash" the city.
