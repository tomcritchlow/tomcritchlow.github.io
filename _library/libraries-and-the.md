Thinking about the role of libraries in the future of social media...

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These are the five core principles of the Brooklyn Public Library.

Found this paper from 2006! **"In the new digital libraries, users are not only consumers but also producers of information"**

New DLs are also required to offer a much richer set of services to their
users than in the past. In particular, they must support the activities of their users
by providing functionalities that may range from general utilities, like annotation,
summarization or co-operative work support, to very audience-specific functions,
like map processing, semantic analysis of images, or simulation. The availability of
this new DL functionality can, in principle, change the way in which research is
conducted. By exploiting such types of DL, for example, a scientist can annotate
the article of a colleague with a programme that extracts useful information from a
large amount of data collected by a specific scientific observatory. This
programme, executed on demand when the annotation is accessed, can
complement the content of the paper with continuously refreshed information.<div><br></div><div>In the new DLs users are not only consumers but also producers of
information. By elaborating information gathered through the DL they can create
new information objects that are published in the DL, thus enriching its content.
The new DLs are thus required to offer services that support the authoring of these
new objects and the workflows that lead to their publication.&nbsp;</div>
