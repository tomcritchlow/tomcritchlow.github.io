Good reminder and guiding principle if you're writing a business book. What people want isn't the same as what they enjoy:

<p>At it’s core, I’d say 4HWW is a bunch of books in one:</p><ol><li><p>A tactical guide for working less an automating work</p></li><li><p>A personal story of how he expanded his imagination for life</p></li><li><p>A subtle philosophical attack on our work beliefs.</p></li></ol><p>I think when people write books they think they need #1 but in reality the most powerful books are always ones with strong personal stories with or without tactics.  Ferriss’ story and the examples of others throughout the book is what was powerful for people.</p><p>This drove my approach with the Pathless Path.  I tried to ask myself a question: what if I didn’t give any playbook, framework, or tactical approaches?</p>
