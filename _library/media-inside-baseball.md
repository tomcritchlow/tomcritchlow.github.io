Media inside baseball, yes. But also great commentary and exploration of the power dynamics against "building a brand" or "being very online"


<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Do%20Journalists%20Need%20to%20Be%20Brands%3F" data-author="Elizabeth Spiers" cite="https://espiers.medium.com/do-journalist-need-to-be-brands-5e0510dfa67b">
<p id="9b6b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph jc jd fy je b gx jf jg jh ha ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx dn gv" data-selectable-paragraph="">This week’s intra-mural media kerfluffle revolves around backlash to the idea that journalists need to be brands themselves — apart from the institutions they work for. It was precipitated by an article in Insider about <em class="jy">The New York Times</em> and retention problems potentially caused by <a class="dy jz" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-times-reporters-frustrated-over-outside-work-policies-2022-3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the <em class="jy">Times</em>’ approach to outside projects</a>.</p><p id="6fcb" class="pw-post-body-paragraph jc jd fy je b gx jf jg jh ha ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx dn gv" data-selectable-paragraph="">At the center of this conversation on Twitter were two high-profile <em class="jy">Times</em> journalists, Maggie Haberman, and Taylor Lorenz, the latter of whom recently left the Times for <em class="jy">The Washington Post</em>. The short version of what happened is that Lorenz pointed to the Insider article (in which she is quoted) and affirmed that it’s important for younger journalists especially to develop themselves as brands and Haberman responded by accusing Lorenz of attention-seeking, and a host of other established journalists chimed in with whatever the Tweet equivalent is of a vomit emoji, mostly triggered by the word “brand” but also by the dynamic at play between Lorenz and Haberman.</p>
