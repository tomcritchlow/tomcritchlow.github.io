I'm planning and building a new walkable sci-fi story called [Glitch Gowanus](https://tomcritchlow.com/glitchgowanus/). It's based on a geo-caching walking treasure hunt experience I built for my fiancee to propose to her.

There are a lot of details to work out but I'm excited to experiment with it.

Here I'm going to archive and collect interesting things about Gowanus, location based web products etc.
