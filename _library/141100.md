Love this surprisingly insightful and useful theory of "step-by-step-ism" from Venkat:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tagging an interesting microtrend that also looks important: a “step-by-step” ethos developing momentum. A general interest in break-king illegible learning processes into their component steps and refining them. A kind of process skill mindfulness. Like 6-sigma but for learning.</p>— Venkatesh Rao (@vgr) <a href="https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1529870394034794499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 26, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In particular:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have a theory in this. I’m very fond of the notion of “threshold concepts”. It’s the idea that there are crucial concepts in any discipline that have a paradigm shifting impact on the mind. They’re take you over a threshold that changes your perspective. <a href="https://t.co/L5TbaP9akF">pic.twitter.com/L5TbaP9akF</a></p>&mdash; drnick 🗳️² (@DrNickA) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrNickA/status/1529884287398559745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 26, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
