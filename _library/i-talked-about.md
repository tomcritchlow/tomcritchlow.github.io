I talked about [questions as scaffolding](https://tomcritchlow.com/2022/03/08/architecture-blogging/) here, and I like this idea of a [learning question](https://medium.com/enrol-yourself/how-to-find-your-learning-question-and-why-you-should-645fe62b7904):

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="How to find your Learning Question (and why you should)" data-author="Zahra Davidson" cite="https://medium.com/enrol-yourself/how-to-find-your-learning-question-and-why-you-should-645fe62b7904">
<h1 id="3008" class="ln lo iz bo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk gb" data-selectable-paragraph="">What is a Learning Question?</h1><p id="1452" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kh ki iz kj b kk ml km kn ko mm kq kr ks mn ku kv kw mo ky kz la mp lc ld le is gb" data-selectable-paragraph="">A Learning Question is a like a thesis question. It’s your own unique course title. It frames your goals, challenges or curiosities as a site for active exploration and response. It’s an itch you have to scratch.</p><p id="1452" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kh ki iz kj b kk ml km kn ko mm kq kr ks mn ku kv kw mo ky kz la mp lc ld le is gb" data-selectable-paragraph=""><span>It’s important that a Learning Question be open. Open questions are ‘designed to encourage a full and meaningful answer using the subject’s own knowledge and/or feelings’. They are the opposite of closed questions which encourage single-word answers.</span></p><p id="9b35" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kh ki iz kj b kk kl km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le is gb" data-selectable-paragraph="">Similarly, a Learning Question is designed to encourage a full and meaningful <em class="my">enquiry</em>. It’s more about provoking a process of learning than about finding an answer, but if you do seek an answer it must be one that incorporates your growing knowledge and personal perspective.</p><p id="c369" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kh ki iz kj b kk kl km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le is gb" data-selectable-paragraph="">Very often a Learning Question spawns a series of new questions which continue to move you forward and help you grow. Unlike an academic thesis question a Learning Question does not seek resolution as an enormous written paper! It seeks a creative response appropriate to the question.</p><p id="5a21" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kh ki iz kj b kk kl km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le is gb" data-selectable-paragraph="">The question can be seen as an externalisation of an inner purpose that is of great importance to the learner. This importance could be practical and immediate (e.g. ‘how can I gain the skills I need to get promoted?’) — or more philosophical (e.g. ‘what is hope and can it be designed?’).</p>
