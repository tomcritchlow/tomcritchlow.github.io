I'm very interested in new ways of networking writing. You can see some thoughts on that in my post [experiments in networked writing](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/01/05/networked-writing/).

Most of my thinking on annotations is contained in this post: [exploring the UX of web-annotations](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/12/annotations/)

[Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/) is the best in class at the moment but still has a long way to go. It feels robust but without a strong UX (especially so on mobile where it almost entirely fails).

[https://crowdlaaers.org/](https://crowdlaaers.org/) is an interesting looking tool that provides a dashboard for a URL (with they had the ability to do a whole site) to show how many annotations there are, from who, over time.

[Genius](https://genius.com/web-annotator) actually has a better UX but as a VC-backed monstrosity I have no faith that they'll be around for much longer (wouldn't be surprised if Vox buys them for cheap at some point to fold the annotation layer into Chorus)

Whoah - check out this service that live-transcribes C-SPAN into gdoc, allows for in-line commenting in the gdoc then spits that back out as JSON for web-display:
