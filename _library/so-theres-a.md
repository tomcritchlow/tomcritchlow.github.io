So there's a [digital naturalism conference](Digital Naturalism Conference). Looks pretty rad! They made a booklet from their last conference in 2019 which you can [see online here](https://archive.org/details/dinacon-2019-single-page-lulu-a-5-printed-2/). Looks fascinating!

Reminds me of this wonderful project from Simon Colly, the [internet of natural things](https://colly.com/work/internet-of-natural-things):

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Work%3A%20Internet%20of%20Natural%20Things" data-author="@colly" cite="https://colly.com/work/internet-of-natural-things">
<p>This self-assigned research project led to a popular newsletter, numerous articles, a touring presentation, and R&amp;D projects. But what does ‘Internet of <em>Natural</em> Things’ mean? Well, throughout history, societies have collectively reinvented their <em>image</em> of nature, so it’s logical that we are now defining a new image of nature for the post-digital age. And with that comes a new and more authentic idea of beauty that designers can embrace.</p>
<p>The research has many strands. I’m exploring biophilic thinking in art, design, architecture and emerging tech. There’s great overlap with mental health and wellbeing. I’m particularly interested in the ways data and social media help us track animals, invest in them, and crowdsource their stories. I’m fascinated by how all of these strands coalesce to influence culture and aesthetics.</p>
<p>I want to understand how nature can play into a better relationship with digital technology, and how technologists and designers can work with, not against, the natural world. The guiding idea is not that we need less technology, but that we need <em>more nature</em>.</p>
