I love this meditation and exploration on web-books:

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Future%20of%20the%20book.%20Manifesto%20of%C2%A0Bureau%C2%A0Gorbunov%20Publishing" data-author="" cite="https://bureau.rocks/books/manifesto/">
Existing e‑books stand far from high standards of&nbsp;paper book publishing. Typography is poor, navigation and&nbsp;search are inconvenient. I&nbsp;present my vision of&nbsp;the&nbsp;future of&nbsp;books realized&nbsp;in&nbsp;bureau’s interactive books on design, which we publish and&nbsp;sell using in‑house technology and&nbsp;subscription business model. I will show live demo of&nbsp;our books and&nbsp;share actual sales numbers.

Remind me of the stuff Craig Mod was writing a decade ago...

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Post Artifact Books and Publishing" data-author="Craig Mod" cite="https://craigmod.com/journal/post_artifact/">
<p>As I stated before, <strong>we will always debate:</strong><br>
<em>the quality of the paper, the pixel density of the display;<br> 
the cloth used on covers, the interface for highlighting;<br> 
location by page, location by paragraph.</em>
</p>
<p>This is not what matters. Surface is secondary.</p>
<p>The ditch digging,<br> the setting of steel,<br> the pouring of concrete for the foundation of the future book.<br> <em>This</em> is what requires our efforts.</p> 
<p>Clearly defined scope of these systems,<br> clearly defined open protocols.<br> <em>These</em> are what require our discussion.</p> 
<p>Tools with simple, quiet, clean interfaces<br> organically surfacing our changing relationship with text.<br> <em>These</em> are what we need to build.</p>
<p>All of these efforts combined, these systems integrated,<br> these tools made well and deliberately.<br> This is the future book.<br> Our platform for post-artifact books and publishing.</p>

We still haven't solved all of this but I love thinking about the future of the book. Especially the practical notions of how to make both web and print books in 2022 (a pragmatic concern for me!).....

More soon
