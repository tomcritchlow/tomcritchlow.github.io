So now I've rolled out my new site design I want to generate some new open graph images (the old white/green sqaure is a bit out of date)...

This looks like a very promising approach:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ah sorry to be clear I built that site and the screenshot service. `internal-api-screenshot` is a fork of this project <a href="https://t.co/2aUPUkrwI2">https://t.co/2aUPUkrwI2</a><br><br>Though you *could* just use this existing instance `<a href="https://t.co/1VSBl7FY1p">https://t.co/1VSBl7FY1p</a>`, production usage is sponsored by Netlify.</p>&mdash; Zach Leatherman (@zachleat) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/1470860369291890690?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Though - I really wish that you could use SVG files as open graph images, then I could generate them dynamically via Jekyll!
