description: "Knowledge, as they say, is power. But knowledge without context is often meaningless."
insights:
 - "The further the learning space is from the doing space, the harder it is to internalize and put into practice. Ultimately organizing your documentation is about finding ways to shrink this gap and make it easier to discover and use the knowledge stored in your documentation when you need it most."
