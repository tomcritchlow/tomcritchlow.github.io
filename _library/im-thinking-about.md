I'm thinking about Libraries - both literal, physical existing libraries AND conceptual future digital "libraries".

Especially in the context of my [library.json project](https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/04/15/library-json/) how can we ensure that a project all about books can funnel value back to libraries?.....

<h4><strong>The library of the future</strong></h4><p>You might be saying to yourself: but aren’t all the libraries already built? What’s the next frontier? This brings us to our final can of worms in this series: <strong>What would a public library look like on the internet?</strong> This question is so intriguing, yet so complex and nuanced, that many of you had a lot to say on the subject last week in our most engaged <a href="https://newpublic.substack.com/p/tuesday-open-thread-libraries/comments" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Open Thread</a> in months. Some of you thought that anything attempting to replace libraries digitally was inexorably doomed to fail, and others were eager to bring their favorite features of their library — from shushing librarians to storytime — to some corner of their daily digital routine.&nbsp;</p><p>We believe this conversation is just getting started. We did a Library Design Sprint with librarians, designers, and researchers in summer 2020, and we tracked how Brooklyn Public Library went online early in the pandemic in our <a href="https://newpublic.org/study/1465/terra-incognita-nyc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Terra Incognita project</a>. This is a topic we’re still extremely interested in, and I’m looking forward to revisiting it in future newsletters. If you have a vision for the intersection of technology and libraries, we’d love to hear more about it in the comments, even if you’re not a billionaire.&nbsp;</p>
