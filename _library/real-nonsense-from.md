"Real nonsense"

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Letter from Sol Lewitt to Eva Hesse" data-author="@lettersofnote" cite="https://lettersofnote.com/2015/07/06/do/">
<p>From your description, and from what I know of your previous work and your ability; the work you are doing sounds very good “Drawing – clean – clear but crazy like machines, larger and bolder… real nonsense.” That sounds fine, wonderful — real nonsense. Do more. More nonsensical, more crazy, more machines, more breasts, penises, cunts, whatever — make them abound with nonsense. Try and tickle something inside you, your “weird humor.” You belong in the most secret part of you. Don’t worry about cool, make your own uncool. Make your own, your own world. If you fear, make it work for you — draw & paint your fear & anxiety. And stop worrying about big, deep things such as “to decide on a purpose and way of life, a consistant approach to even some impossible end or even an imagined end.” 
You must practice being stupid, dumb, unthinking, empty. Then you will be able to DO</p>
