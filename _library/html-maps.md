Why is it so hard to make maps on the web. We interact with maps all day long, but only in very pre-determined ways.

Where are the exploratory, creative ways to build, play with and remix location-based content? A few things I've seen:

[Hello lamppost](http://www.hellolamppost.co.uk/) - and the great talk where this idea is teased out [some of these things are not like the others](https://tomarmitage.com/2014/12/02/some-of-these-things-are-not-like-the-others/)

[Urbanimals](https://www.playablecity.com/projects/urbanimals/) from the Playable City project.

[Localize.city](https://www.localize.city/) - not sure who is behind this but it's a delightful UI

[A barrow by a beacon](http://barrow.matthewsheret.com/) - wonderful meditation on walking from Matthew Sheret

[In the map room](https://medium.com/@blprnt/in-the-map-room-cd6b06bf2139) - an art project of annotating IRL digital maps projected on the floor. Wonderful.
