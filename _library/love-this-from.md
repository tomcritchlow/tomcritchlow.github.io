Love this from Simon - his stream is the primary inspiration for this notes microblog...

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Stream%20on" data-author="@colly" cite="https://colly.com/articles/stream-on">
<p class="as-subtitle">It’s two years since I started my Stream, a channel for quickfire posts alongside my more glacial blog, and I recently posted my 250th note. That’s 250 thoughts that would otherwise have gone undocumented or evaporated elsewhere.</p>

<p>It’s not lost on me that I am writing an <a href="https://colly.com/articles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Article</a> about my <a href="https://colly.com/stream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stream</a>. But, as you will read, this isn’t a short post, and my Articles section is here when I need more depth. I’ve given myself options.</p>
