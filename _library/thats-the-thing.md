From the great album by Sam Fender. This lyric has crushed me recently - I keep seeing this idea everywhere.

From yelling at my kids to watching people behave angrily on the subway... Anger is such an insidious force that just destroys people from the inside out.

There's always room to breathe. Don't pay your anger forward.
